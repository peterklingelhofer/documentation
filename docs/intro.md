# Introduction

Let's discover **Resonate in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by getting our [music streaming player](https://github.com/resonatecoop/stream) up and running in your development environment.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Clone down the repository

Resonate's `stream` repository will automatically be added to your current directory after you run the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resonatecoop/stream.git
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

Now run these commands to installs all necessary dependencies you need to run the Resonate streaming platform:

```bash
cd stream
npm install
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Resonate web player site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

## Start the web player

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
